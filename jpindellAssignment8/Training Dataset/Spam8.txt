This is your chance to meet senior leadership from OSD, Joint Staff, COCOMS, US Army, and Coast Guard. You will gain insight from these senior leaders into their organizations and learn:  

How IT will be used to improve combat support, Joint Warfighter effectiveness, and overall readiness. 
Why the Army is planning to move towards streamlining the acquisition process towards a SOCOM-like acquisition model of buy, try, decide and acquire.   
How and why SOCOM acquisition leaders implemented buy, try, decide, and acquire.
Accelerated acquisition approaches being used and considered including Other Transaction Authority (OTAs), GWACS, and other vehicles that will support accelerating acquisition in support of mission critical requirements.
Current capability gaps and planned acquisitions. 
Industry opportunities to provide technology and services to DOD.

There are three standard sponsorship packages available - Platinum, Gold & Small Business Silver – as well as special Premiere slots sponsoring the Breakfast, Luncheon, or Closing Reception, and new Diamond Sponsorships, which give you the greatest level of exposure.
