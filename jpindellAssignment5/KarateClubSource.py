def karate_club_graph():

	"""
	Return Zachary's Karate Club graph. 
	Each node in the returned graph has a node attribute ``'club'`` that
	indicates the name of the club to which the member represented by that node
	belongs, either ``'Mr. Hi'`` or ``'Officer'``.

	Examples
	--------
	To get the name of the club to which a node belongs::

	>>> import networkx as nx
	>>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
	>>> G.node[5]['club']
	'Mr. Hi'
	>>> G.node[9]['club']
	'Officer'
